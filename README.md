## ü§ì Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

#### ERD - Diagram <br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## üìö Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:13.0
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../src/dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## üìä Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL querys to achieve the following results:

1. Count the total number of states in each country.

```postgresql
select
    countries.name ,
    count(states)
from states
         left join countries on states.country_id = countries.id
group by
    countries.name;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result1.png" alt="result_1"/>
</p>

2. How many employees do not have supervisores.

```postgresql
select count(*) as employees_without_bosses
from employees
where supervisor_id IS NULL;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result2.png" alt="result_2"/>
</p>

3. List the top five offices address with the most amount of employees, order the result by country and display a column with a counter.

```postgresql
select
    countries.name,
    offices.address,
    count(office_id)
from employees
         left join offices on employees.office_id = offices.id
         left join countries on offices.country_id = countries.id
group by
    offices.address,
    countries.name
order by
    count(office_id) desc
    limit 5;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result3.png" alt="result_3"/>
</p>

4. Three supervisors with the most amount of employees they are in charge.

```postgresql
select
    supervisor_id,
    count(supervisor_id)
from employees
group by
    supervisor_id
order by
    count(supervisor_id) desc
    limit 3;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result4.png" alt="result_4"/>
</p>

5. How many offices are in the state of Colorado (United States).

```postgresql
select
    count(*) as list_of_office
from offices
         left join states on offices.state_id = states.id
where
    states.name = 'Colorado';
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result5.png" alt="result_5"/>
</p>

6. The name of the office with its number of employees ordered in a desc.

```postgresql
select
    offices.name,
    count(office_id)
from employees
         left join offices on offices.id = employees.office_id
group by
    offices.name
order by
    count(office_id) desc;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result6.png" alt="result_6"/>
</p>

7. The office with more and less employees.

```postgresql

(select
     offices.address,
     count(office_id)
 from employees
          left join offices on offices.id = employees.office_id
 group by
     offices.address
 order by
     count(office_id) desc
 limit 1)

union

(select
     offices.address,
     count(office_id)
 from employees
          left join offices on offices.id = employees.office_id
 group by
     offices.address
 order by
     count(office_id) asc
 limit 1);

```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result7.png" alt="result_7"/>
</p>

8. Show the uuid of the employee, first_name and lastname combined, email, job_title, the name of the office they belong to, the name of the country, the name of the state and the name of the boss (boss_name)

```postgresql
select
    e.uuid,
    e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name as full_name,
    e.email,
    e.job_title,
    offices.name as company,
    countries.name as country,
    states.name as state,
    supervisors.first_name
from employees as e
         left join offices on offices.id = e.office_id
         left join countries on offices.country_id = countries.id
         left join states on offices.state_id = states.id
         left join employees as supervisors on e.supervisor_id = supervisors.id
where
    e.supervisor_id is not null;
```
